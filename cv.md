**Briefly about myself**

I'm punctual and time-oriented, because it is not easy to set up the schedule of a family with a preschool child, but I always manage to do everithing on time.

I'm open for communication, I can find an approach to any person. I like being in the community of people related to programming, learning something new and putting it into practice.

I have a structured view of things, so I realized that programming is my element, wich I entered and I feel great. And thanks to Front-end Development, I can also apply the stylistic skills that are inherit in me.
